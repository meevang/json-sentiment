2 Contributors1990 LyricsWell, we got trouble in the White House
Poverty in the ghetto
When will it end?
Nobody knows!
People are asking now
"How can you spend another dollar on the space race"
"When families at home are starving right in front of your face."
Where is your heart, America?
Thousand of jobless people walking the streets
With no food or place to sleep
What will become of them, America?
I heard some people saying they had a solution
"All we got to do is change the constitution!"
What about air pollution, America?
America!
Don't get me wrong, I still love ya
In spite of all your troubles and woes
In my eyes you're still the greatest of them all!
America!
I ain't ashamed to say that I love ya
There ain't another place on Earth I'd rather be
We won all the battles there were to win
Pray that the war is at an end
That's what people pray
Listen to them, America!
America!
Don't get me wrong, I still love ya
In spite of all your troubles and woes
In my eyes you're still the greatest of them all!
America!
I ain't ashamed to say that I love ya
There ain't another place on Earth I'd rather beSee The Temptations LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also likeEmbed
