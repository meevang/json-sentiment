2 Contributors4 Days Lyrics[Intro]
You don't have to take that from him baby
Listen listen

[Verse 1]
Look at how he treats you, baby
Should've listened when your mama said
"Girl you don't need him if you can't see him on the weekend"
You need to listen to your intuition
You need to leave him before your heart gets broken, baby
And when you page him and he don't call back
[?]

[Chorus] X2
4 days
Of heartache and pain
3 days
Of crying your eyes out
2 days
Of ripping up his pictures
When he calls you girl
You take him right back

[Verse 2]
He says, "I'm sorry" but you know he don't mean it
You gotta feeling that he has another friend
[?]
But in a couple of days [?]
Now I'm not tryna salt his game
But when your hurt you know it's hurtin' me the same
[?] independent woman
And leave him
First time he hurt you it was bad, baby
The second time you know it really made me mad
The third time baby shame on you
Just how long are you gonna sit back and play the fool

4 days
Of heartache and pain
3 days
Of crying your eyes out
2 days
Of ripping up his picture
When he calls you girl, you take him right backEmbed
