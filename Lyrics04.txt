4 ContributorsA Fine Mess LyricsLove, on the border line
It's messing with my mind
I just won't give you up
I'm tired of falling
Get back up

See I know one of these nights
You'll find me there
When I'm in over my head with you
I don't care

It's a fine mess that we're getting in
We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him
It's a fine mess
And I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than you
More than you

Wait by the telephone
Wondering if he's not home
Leave in the nick of time
Girl would you ever be on mind

See I know one of these night
He'll find me there
When I'm in over my head with you
I don't care

We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him
It's a fine mess
And I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than you
More than you

Both of us are crazy
Both of us are fools
There's so many ways a man can dream of being cruel
I don't want to be around when he finds I'm the one
Dancing with his baby
And loving her on the run

It's a fine mess that we're getting in
We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him
It's a fine mess
And I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than you

It's a fine mess
Hey, hey, hey
We've been alone tonight
And there ain't no sign of him no
It's a fine mess and I don't know what to do
Cause I may wind up losing, baby
More than youEmbed
